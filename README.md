# Bayesian Optimization Implementation (Forked from Professor Andrea Cossu's Project)

This repository is a fork of the original Bayesian Optimization project developed by Professor Andrea Cossu. It contains an additional program that implements Bayesian Optimizazion of hyperparameters thanks to the use of the library **Optuna**.


## How to Use BayesianOpt.py

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
2. ## TODO


## Citation

- Original code and model functions: **Professor Andrea Cossu** (University of Pisa)

## Libraries Used

- [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) - A hyperparameter optimization framework to automate hyperparameter search.
